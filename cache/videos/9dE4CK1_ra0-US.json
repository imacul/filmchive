But when Sarah suddenly goes missing after basketball tryouts, Claire's life is thrown into a tailspin. Though the police are determined that her search is futile, Claire knows that her daughter is in danger. And someone else knows it too--it seems there are members of Claire's new community willing to go to dangerous lengths to stop her from learning the truth, including the team's coach. Claire will need to uncover the town's darkest secrets if she ever hopes to see her daughter again.\n \n#SecretsinaSmallTown\n\nWatch Lifetime Movies anytime with the Lifetime Movie Club app:\nhttps://mylt.tv/LifetimeMovieClub\n\nFind out more about this and other Lifetime movies on our site:\nhttps://mylt.tv/LifetimeMovies\n                                                                                                                                                         \nCheck out exclusive Lifetime content:\nWebsite - https://mylt.tv/myLifetime\nFacebook - https://mylt.tv/facebook\nTwitter - https://mylt.tv/twitter      \n\nLifetimeÂ® is a premier female-focused entertainment destination dedicated to providing viewers with a diverse selection of critically acclaimed and award-winning original movies, scripted dramas, and unscripted programming.
