  "description": "Academy AwardÂ®-nominated filmmaker Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally) returns to the romantic comedy in good form in this witty, wild and warmhearted adaptation of the bestselling young adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen. Following the relationship of a boy and girl who are neighbors, from ages 7 to 13, this teen comedy unfolds their story from each others' perspectives: she loves him at first sight while he instantly dislikes her, but gradually their relationship flips as they get to know one another...and he tries to win her back. From grade school to junior high, they face triumph and disaster, family drama and first love, as they make the discoveries that will define who they are -- and who they are to each other. With a strong ensemble cast including Aidan Quinn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Mahoney, Anthony Edwards, Rebecca DeMornay and more, FLIPPED is flat-out fun, no matter how you look at it.",
