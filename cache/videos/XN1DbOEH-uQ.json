During his experiment, Sebastian meets Emma, a kind-hearted idealist who works at a charity center. Her unwavering faith in people inspires him to view life and business from a different perspective.\n\nSebastianâ€™s secret is at risk of exposure when his colleagues begin questioning his disappearance.
