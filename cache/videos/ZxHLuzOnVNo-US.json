  "description": "Django Unchained is a 2012 American revisionist Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson, with Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, James Remar, Michael Parks, and Don Johnson in supporting roles. Set in the Old West and Antebellum South, it is a highly stylized, heavily revisionist tribute to spaghetti Westerns, in particular the 1966 Italian film Django by Sergio Corbucci (the star of which, Franco Nero, has a cameo appearance). The story follows a slave who trains under a German bounty hunter with the ultimate goal of reuniting with his wife.\n\nBecome a Sponsor of the Silver Screen Breakdowns Podcast!\nðŸ‘‰https://app.redcircle.com/shows/4c3e97fc-13a4-4828-b9ce-8751e780633d/donations\n\nFollow On All Podcasts\nðŸ‘‰http://SSBpod.com\n\nSign up for UNDERDOG FANTASY and play best ball weekly!!! \nðŸ‘‰ https://play.underdogfantasy.com/p-ff-hustler420\n\nTo get into 420 crew to get in leagues, get advice etc click the link below!\nðŸ‘‰ http://www.420Crew.org\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks like the custom 420 Crew Emojis\nðŸ‘‰ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3h5A_3rHRiXne5Sz9aX31Q/join\n\nFollow Alex the 420 Fantasy Hustler on all platforms!\nðŸ‘‰ http://FantasyFootballHustler.com\n\nSponsor the Hustler Podcast\nðŸ‘‰ https://app.redcircle.com/shows/b1e42aad-3cde-4c3f-92bd-874858b0ae5a/donations\n\nFantasy Football Hustler Merch use Promo Code \"FF420\"\nðŸ‘‰ https://420CrewMerch.com\n\nListen to the 420 Crew Playlist on Spotify\nðŸ‘‰ https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2yFVCnlShM6pl3m50wsuiG?si=38114c6584a6439e",
